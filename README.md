# PythonOperation3
A console application that prompts the user to guess a number, the program continues to ask the user for a number until the user guesses correctly. 
The program will tell you to guess higher or lower and it also keeps track of the number of guesses and reads them back to the user at the end.
This program was originally written in Java and I decided it would be fun to try to recreate it in Python!!!
